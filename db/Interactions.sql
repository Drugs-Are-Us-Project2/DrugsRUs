Additionally, a hypoprothrombinemic effect may occur when S-warfarin is combined with sulfaethoxazole/trimethoprim.3\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Avoid concomitant use of a sulfa drug with warfarin, particularly sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Identify microbial pathogen prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Consider culture sensitivity screening as research indicates cautious use of any antibiotic with warfarin. If use of a sulfa drug is imperative, then reduce warfarin dose by 50% during antibiotic administration and for one week following completion of the antibiotic.
